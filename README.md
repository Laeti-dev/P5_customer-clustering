# P5_customer-clustering

## Summary
This project aims to create a clustering model for a bresilian ecommerce website.
After testing several clustering models woth RFM marketing chosen features, the goal was to test the selected model with further features.

Finally, offer a model management plan to see how often the model has to be update to stay accurate.

## Business objectives
The business objectives of this project revolve around improving the understanding of customer behavior for Olist, an e-commerce platform. 

- **Customer Segmentation**: By segmenting clients based on their purchasing behavior, Olist can tailor marketing strategies, leading to more effective campaigns and improved customer retention.
- **Personalization**: Understanding customer profiles allows for personalized recommendations and communications, which can enhance the overall customer experience and drive sales.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Implementing data analysis helps Olist make informed decisions about product offerings, pricing strategies, and customer engagement approaches.
- **Improving Customer Experience**: By analyzing customer data, Olist can identify pain points and opportunities within the customer journey, leading to a better overall experience.

## Learning objectives 
- **Mastering SQL**: Query and manipulate data using SQL to extract insights from datasets.
-  **Understanding Clustering Algorithms**: Understand unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering methods like K-means or hierarchical clustering, to segment customers based on their behaviors.
- **Data Exploration**: Develop skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, find patterns, and identify outliers.
- **Model Maintenance**: Learn how to create, validate, and maintain machine learning models, ensuring they remain relevant over time as new data becomes available.
- **Communication Skills**: Prepare for and practice delivering clear and professional project presentations, effectively conveying findings and methodologies.
- **Application of Learned Skills to Real-World Scenarios**: Apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations in e-commerce, enhancing ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
